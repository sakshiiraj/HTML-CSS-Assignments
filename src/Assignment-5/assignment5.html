					<h2>A Leafy One</h3>
					<p>Leaf vegetables, also called leafy greens, salad greens, pot herbs, vegetable greens, or simply greens, are plant leaves eaten as a vegetable, sometimes accompanied by tender petioles and shoots. Although they come from a very wide variety of plants, most share a great deal with other leaf vegetables in nutrition and cooking methods.</p>

					<h2>Some Pointy Ones</h3>
					<p>When it comes to plants that have sharp edges, many gardeners may immediately think of plants like succulents and cacti. Though these plants are better suited to drier regions, they can thrive in most places, as long as the proper growing conditions are provided. If these plants are not ideal for your yard, however, many other sharp leaved plants are available in the form of palms and ornamental grasses.</p>
